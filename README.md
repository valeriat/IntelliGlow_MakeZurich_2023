# IntelliGlow_MakeZurich_2023



## Purpose
The initial idea behind this project was to utilize machine learning to optimize the switching on and off of lights based on human activity within a given space. The concept involved having a camera to observe what people were doing indoors; for instance, were they reading, relaxing, sleeping, or was the room empty? The plan was to use machine learning to analyze these situations and adjust the lighting conditions accordingly.

## Challenges
However, we quickly encountered several challenges that led us to reassess our approach. Our primary obstacle was the lack of camera sensors, which led us to implement a simplified version of our system using motion sensors and ultrasonic sensors. Furthermore, we discovered that the energy required for updating and analyzing data could potentially exceed the energy saved through optimized lighting. Additionally, conversations with peers led us to question the necessity of using machine learning to optimize the lighting conditions in a domestic environment.

## Future Plans
In response to these challenges, we pivoted our project's focus. The first major change was in the target application. We realized that while this system might not be ideal for a home environment, it could be incredibly beneficial in other settings such as care homes. It could significantly help elderly individuals or those with disabilities who might struggle with simple tasks like switching lights on and off.

Another potential application is large offices with numerous lights. The system could utilize a camera to track people's movements and decide which lights should be turned on or off based on their positions. We could also integrate light-sensing sensors to adjust the lighting based on natural light conditions. For instance, if a light is closer to a window and it's sunny outside, the light could be dimmed or switched off to save energy.

We believe there are many more potential applications for our smart lighting system, and we are excited to continue exploring them.
